                        This is a paragraph about me! I just graduated with a degree in Networking Technologies from Wake Technical Community College. I decided Networking was not the field I wanted to pursue afterall. So here I am learning how to write CSS and HTML!<br>
                        <br> I am quite excited about the programming languages we will go over in this course, especially Javascript! I have experience with Python (the language that got me into coding), and I was told that it would make picking up Javascript
                        a bit easier. I have some experience with relational databases. However it is only rudimentary and I am looking forward to learning some of the backend technologies. I currently deliver pizza to pay the bills while I am taking
                        this class and I have cut my hours to make room for a successful program.
                        <br>
                        <br>I live in Cary (right on the edge of Durham and Morrisville) right next to RTP! I moved in only 6 months ago with my now fiancee, we will be getting married a few months after this program concludes. Hopefully by the end of
                        this year I will be married and have a new job and a new home! The motivation for me to do well in this course is high. However I know two people that have taken the course and are now working in the industry as devs. One of them
                        is a close friend and the other is my brother! My brother had an art degree before deciding this was a good route for him to make a career change. So the evidence shows if I will reap the benefits if I put in the effort!
